# The 2010-2017 drop in drug-related arrests in SF

In 2018 the San Francisco Police Department published a historical record of all the department’s Incident Reports between 2003 and 2018. This detailed and lengthy dataset offers great insight on the crime scene of the fourth biggest city in California, and a new perspective of policework in SF other than that seen in Dirty Harry.

Upon closer examination of this record, many interesting patterns emerge from the data. One of them is the huge drop in drug-related arrests after 2010. But was the reason for this? Was it that people stopped using drugs with the start of the decade? Or was it something that had to do with the police’s ability to tackle these cases? This is the story of the reasons behind this drop, and it involves drugs, corrupt officers and high-ranking politicians.

Let’s take it from the top. In December 2009, Deborah Madden, a crime lab technician for SFPD, was accused of, and eventually pleaded guilty to stealing cocaine from the evidence and taking it home. This came to verify previously reported problems about malpractice in the crime lab, overworked technicians and falsified documents.

This event started a domino effect with severe consequences on the SFPD’s ability to handle drug-related cases. The arrest of Deborah Madden inflicted a huge blow to the police lab’s credibility and the ability to support the analyses’ results in court. A new police chief was appointed to deal with the situation. The DA’s office, who by that time was none other than today’s Vice President of the USA, Kamala Harris, also took a serious hit: Political opponents came to claim that since the lab was under Harris’ authority, she had “systematically violated defendants’ civil and constitutional rights” because her office hid “damaging information about a police drug lab technician and was indifferent to demands that it account for its failings.”

After this, events started snowballing. The police department had to close down its lab in order to re-train officers for the job leaving a large number of cases up in the air. Even though at first the DA’s office estimated that only around 20 cases would be affected, in the following months Harris took the extraordinary step of dismissing about 1,000 drug-related cases, including many in which convictions had been obtained and sentences were being served. This action is reflected in the steep decline of drug-related arrest in the years following 2010.

The backlash caused by the scandal also resulted in budget cuts being made for the SFPD. The limited funding for drug enforcement operations lead to a change in priorities, meaning that the police began focusing more on midlevel drug dealers and drug offenses often associated with violent crimes, shifting their focus from minor drug possession cases, like marijuana.

Sheriff Michael Hennessey commented that “This has been somewhat of a de facto decriminalization of drugs — in other words, they’re not being prosecuted”. Capt. Greg Corrales of the Mission district, a hotbed of drug activity, stated that “If we encounter marijuana dealers, we will arrest them, although that is not a major priority”.

Several conclusions can be reached from this story. First, it is notable that even though the arrests on drugs have dropped significantly, there hasn’t been a rise in violent incidents in SF. This means that the generally accepted positive correlation between drugs and violent crimes should be reconsidered.

A second point worth mentioning is how these events affected those involved in it. Deborah Madden was sentenced to one year of home confinement and five years of probation for misdemeanor cocaine possession by a federal judge. “I’m not proud of the way I ended my career. I ended it in a shameful way” she said after the trial. Kamala Harris, who at the moment of the scandal was running to become California’s elected attorney general, was evidently not greatly affected by it. She managed to pull through it successfully, climbing up the ladder to where she is today. And George Gascón, the then newly appointed police chief, was elected to replace Harris as the San Francisco District Attorney in 2011.

But the most important lesson to be learned in this story, is the one hiding behind the first impression given by the data. Even though in general drug-related arrests have been decreasing in SF for years, this has not been the case for all categories of drugs. The use of opiates has been on the rise in the USA and SF is one of the places where the problem is greater. What is more, it is important to showcase that not every place in SF is affected to the same degree. “The Tenderloin district had the most drug arrests both this year and last. Drug dealers often come to the Tenderloin from other parts of The City and beyond to ply their trade, in particular crack cocaine and heroin sales”, local Capt. Joe Garrity stated. It is the importance of these facts that the publishing of the historical reports should be aiming to highlight, in order to raise awareness and shift public interest towards it. And it is the data analysts job to extract this information and transform data into knowledge.
